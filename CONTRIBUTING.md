# Contributing

The [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) can be used to 
submit pull requests.

It's best to inquire about an issue, or open an issue for discussion, before 
working on it. This prevents different people working on the same issue, or 
prevents your patches from being rejected.
